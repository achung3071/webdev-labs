What is the value of SQLAlchemy?

As an ORM, SQLAlchemy makes communication with relational databases easier by mapping database entities / tables
to Python objects that can be directly accessed in a Python program. Not only that, but it is database agnostic,
so it provides a uniform interface that can interact with various kinds of relational databases

What is a model?

A model is the structure (in this assignment, a Python class) which manages the data within a specific table of
the database. It accepts user input (like a query) and returns data based on the input.

What is a view?

A view is the interface that users interact with; in the context of this project, it is the logic behind the
REST API endpoints that users make requests to.
